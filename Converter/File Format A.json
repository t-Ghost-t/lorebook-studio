Only beings composed of physical matter and flesh can directly manifest a Trait, such as humans and monsters who have consumed food made by humanity. The only method for someone to naturally obtain their Trait is by having an experience in their lives that required them to have a certain behavior. The SOUL of a human usually inflicts its magic on-to the human using it, giving the human a slight change. Depending on the Soul trait of a human, the human\u2019s eye color will usually be the same color as their Soul, and in some instances, hair as well. When a human dies, they will slowly lose their traits.",
